NetworkMonitor for Network Programming in Python

The agent can run on every computer with python3 installed.


The agent captures all the packets on eth0You can edit the network interface. All the packet data is putted in a mysql database.


The client can also run on every computer with python3 installed. It connect's to the mysql database and reads the packets.
I have used the following libaries:

Cursus: To make the client user interface
PyMySQL: Mysql client for python
PyLibPcap-0.6.4: To sniff the packets
